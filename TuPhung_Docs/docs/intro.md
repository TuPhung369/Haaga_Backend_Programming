- **Multi-factor Authentication** - Secure login with TOTP and email OTP options with replay protection
- **OAuth2 Integration** - Seamless login with Google, Facebook, and GitHub
- **Role-based Access Control** - Granular permission system for precise access management
- **Real-time Collaboration** - WebSocket-based messaging system for instant team communication
- **Kanban Task Management** - Visual workflow organization with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Company Calendar** - Centralized event scheduling and department coordination
- **AI Productivity Assistants** - Intelligent virtual assistants to automate routine tasks
- **Language AI Development** - Speech recognition and processing to help employees improve communication skills
- **Department Coordination** - Tools for cross-functional team alignment and project tracking
- **Employee Performance Insights** - Analytics to help team members track and improve their productivity

The system architecture illustrates the secure and scalable design of Enterprise Nexus. Client browsers connect to the React/TypeScript frontend, which communicates with the Spring Boot backend through both REST API (for data operations) and WebSockets (for real-time features). The backend implements a multi-layered security approach with double encryption for tokens and TOTP secrets using dynamically generated keys.

Authentication services provide multiple secure login options including TOTP with replay protection, email verification, and OAuth2 integration. The AI services layer enhances productivity through virtual assistants and language processing capabilities, while the speech processing module powered by SpeechBrain enables advanced voice recognition for employee skill development. All data is securely stored in PostgreSQL with proper access controls and encryption.

## Getting Started

To navigate this comprehensive documentation, use the sidebar on the left to explore different sections of Enterprise Nexus. Each page provides detailed information about specific components, including code examples, flowcharts, and explanations of implementation details.

For a comprehensive understanding of the platform, we recommend starting with the Architecture overview to grasp the security model and component interactions, then exploring the Frontend and Backend sections to understand how different features are implemented.

Enterprise Nexus is designed to be deployed within your organization's infrastructure, with flexible configuration options to adapt to your specific security requirements and integration needs.

## Security Architecture

Enterprise Nexus implements a sophisticated security model:

1. **Multi-layered Token Encryption** - Access and refresh tokens are encrypted twice with dynamically generated keys
2. **TOTP Authentication** - Time-based one-time passwords with replay protection
3. **Email OTP Verification** - Secondary authentication channel
4. **OAuth2 Integration** - Secure third-party authentication
5. **Role-based Access Control** - Granular permission management
6. **HTTPS Everywhere** - All communications are encrypted in transit
7. **Secure Password Storage** - Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms
