        full system access
    end note

## User Management Overview

The Enterprise Nexus Project implements a comprehensive user management system that handles the complete lifecycle of users within the application. The system provides secure authentication, role-based access control, profile management, and administrative capabilities.

## User Roles and Permissions

The system implements a hierarchical role-based access control system with the following roles:

| Role | Description | Access Level | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Admin** | System administrator | Full system access | All system functions, user management, configuration |
| **Manager** | Team or project manager | Team and project management | Manage teams, projects, and resources |
| **User** | Standard system user | Standard functionality | Access core features, own content, shared resources |
| **Guest** | Limited access user | Read-only access | View public resources and shared content |

### Permission Hierarchy

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Role {
        +String name
        +String description
        +List~Permission~ permissions
        +boolean isSystemRole
    }
    
    class Permission {
        +String name
        +String description
        +String resource
        +PermissionType type
    }
    
    class PermissionType {
        READ
        WRITE
        DELETE
        ADMIN
    }
    
    class ResourceType {
        USER
        TEAM
        PROJECT
        CHAT
        BOARD
        TASK
        EVENT
        SYSTEM
    }
    
    Role "1" *-- "many" Permission : contains
    Permission -- PermissionType : has
    Permission -- ResourceType : applies to
```

## User Registration and Onboarding

### Registration Methods

Users can register through multiple channels:

| Method | Description | Verification |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Email & Password | Traditional registration | Email verification |
| Google OAuth | Sign in with Google | Email pre-verified |
| GitHub OAuth | Sign in with GitHub | Email pre-verified |
| Microsoft OAuth | Sign in with Microsoft | Email pre-verified |

### User Onboarding Process

    class A,B,C,D,E,F onboardingSteps
    class G finalState
```

## User Profile Management

### Profile Components

User profiles are comprehensive and include:

        API-->>Client: Image Uploaded
    end
    
    Client->>API: Submit Profile Updates
    API->>Profile: Update Profile
    Profile->>UserDB: Save Updated Data
    UserDB-->>Profile: Update Confirmation
    Profile-->>API: Profile Updated
    API-->>Client: Update Success
    Client-->>User: Profile Updated Confirmation
```

## User Administration

Administrators have powerful tools to manage users across the system:

### Administrative Capabilities

|----------|-------------|--------------|
| User Management | Create, update, delete users | Admin |
| Role Assignment | Assign and modify user roles | Admin |
| Account Recovery | Reset passwords, unlock accounts | Admin, Manager (team only) |
| User Impersonation | Temporarily access as another user | Admin (with audit) |
| Bulk Operations | Perform actions on multiple users | Admin |
| Audit Logging | View detailed user activity logs | Admin |

```

## Security and Password Management

### Password Policies

The system enforces comprehensive password security:

| Policy | Description | Configuration |
