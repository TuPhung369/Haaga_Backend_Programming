# Active Context

## Current Mode: PLAN

## Current Focus: API Design
- Defining API endpoints
  - HTTP methods
  - URL paths
  - Request/response formats
  - Query parameters
  - Pagination approach
  - Authentication requirements
- Documenting API specification in api-spec.md

## Next Steps
- Collaborate with user to define API endpoints
- Prompt for input on key API design decisions
- Document each endpoint in api-spec.md
- Move on to database schema design once API is specified

## Current Phase

- **Mode:** VAN
- **Complexity Level:** 3 (Intermediate Feature)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-04-07

## Context Details

- **Project Name:** Haaga Backend Programming
- **Objective:** Build a backend API for a student management system
- **Current Task:** Task 1 - Initialize project structure and determine complexity

## Notes

- Complexity Level 3 requires full workflow: VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT → QA.
- VAN Mode completed: Project assessed as Level 3 (Intermediate Feature).
- Initial setup and basic endpoints (GET /students) already implemented.
- Transition to PLAN Mode next to plan remaining features (authentication, database, CRUD endpoints, error handling).

## Complexity Assessment

- Rationale:
  - Medium-scope project
  - Multiple API endpoints and database tables
  - User authentication functionality
  - PostgreSQL database integration
  - More than a simple fix, but not a full enterprise system

Based on the Level 3 complexity assessment, the recommended next step is to switch to PLAN mode for thorough planning before starting implementation.

PLAN mode will involve:

- Breaking down the project into granular tasks
- Designing the API endpoints and request/response formats
- Planning the database schema and relationships
- Documenting authentication and error handling approaches
- Outlining implementation details like frameworks and libraries

Once planning is complete, the Memory Bank will be updated with the full project plan, and we can proceed to implementation with a clear roadmap.
