### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a backend REST API for a student management system. The API will allow managing students and courses, with features including:

- Creating, updating, and deleting student records
- Listing available courses
- User authentication
- Integration with a MySQL database for data persistence

The API will expose multiple endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student and course data. It will also include authentication functionality to secure access to the API.

This is a medium-sized project, involving several API endpoints, database tables, and integration with an external SqlSQL database. However, it is not a full-scale enterprise system, as the core functionality is centered around basic CRUD operations.
